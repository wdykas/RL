"""MegatronGeneration: A GenerationInterface implementation for non-colocated
Megatron-based inference.

This module wraps a Policy object (configured for inference only, without
optimizer or reference model) and exposes it through the GenerationInterface.
It enables non-colocated inference where training and generation run on
separate GPU clusters, with weights synchronized via Megatron's
swap_model_weights resharding API.
