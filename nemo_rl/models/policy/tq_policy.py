"""TQ-mediated Policy: meta-driven 1-hop counterpart to ``Policy``.

Exposes ``train_from_meta`` / ``get_logprobs_from_meta`` /
``get_reference_policy_logprobs_from_meta`` — same return shapes as
``Policy.{train, get_logprobs, get_reference_policy_logprobs}`` but
accepting a ``KVBatchMeta`` instead of a ``BatchedDataDict``. The meta
names per-sample TQ keys minted once at rollout
(:class:`nemo_rl.experience.sync_rollout_actor.SyncRolloutActor`); each
dispatch slices the key list per DP rank via
:func:`nemo_rl.data_plane.preshard.shard_meta_for_dp` (no re-fan-out,
no key minting). Workers fetch their slice from TQ via
``self._fetch(meta)`` and write deltas back via
``self._write_back_result_field(...)``. See
``nemo_rl/data_plane/README.md`` for the full design.

    Constructor accepts an additional ``dp_cfg`` (the

    the driver and forwards ``setup_data_plane(dp_cfg)`` to every worker
    so they can attach as clients (``bootstrap=False``).

    ``checkpointing`` is an internal bootstrap mode derived from the existing
    checkpoint settings and resume path, not another user-facing switch. For
    Mooncake it enables hard-pinned memory, disables offload, and keeps the

    named by ``tq_partition_id`` (default ``"train"``) is open with a
